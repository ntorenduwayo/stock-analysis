### Analysis of Outcomes 
- Created a new excel worksheet (i.e. All Stocks Analysis), and I used VBA to create for columns i.e. Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return
- Used "indexes" and "For" loops to look for values from 2017 and 2018 worksheets to calculate the above columns'values 
- Used VBA to find the run time for the program to get all the values
- Automated the program and improved the program running time

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
<p>&nbsp;</p> <!-- Adding a blank line -->
Using only two years worth of data is not sufficient to make a strong conclusion, if we could get more data to sniff throuh we could greatly improve our conclusion and recommendations

- We could also add some statistics and graphs to facilitate the data exploration.
